  Virtualization\cite{HM} is the hot topic in the operating systems 
  these days. It is useful in many scenarios: server consolidation,
  virtual test environments, and for Linux enthusiasts who
  still cannot decide upon the which distribution is best.
  
  \noindent The Kernel Virtual Machine, or \textbf{kvm} is a new Linux
  subsystem which leverages these virtualization extensions
  to add a virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor) capability to Linux.

\section{Background}
  Virtualization is the hot topic in the operating systems\cite{WS} 
  these days. It is useful in many scenarios: server consolidation,
  virtual test environments, and for Linux enthusiasts who
  still cannot decide upon the which distribution is best.
  
  \noindent The Kernel Virtual Machine, or \textbf{kvm} is a new Linux
  subsystem which leverages these virtualization extensions
  to add a virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor) capability to Linux.

\section{MMU virtualization}
Virtualization is the hot topic in the operating systems 
  these days. It is useful in many scenarios: server consolidation\footnote{Consolidate all servers on one machine},
  virtual test environments, and for Linux enthusiasts who
  still cannot decide upon the which distribution is best.

   \subsection{Hardware assisted Paging}
    \noindent Virtualization is the hot topic in the operating systems 
  these days. It is useful in many scenarios: server consolidation,
  virtual test environments, and for Linux enthusiasts who
  still cannot decide upon the which distribution is best.
